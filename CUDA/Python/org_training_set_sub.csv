      SOS Villages d'Enfants est n&eacute;e en 1956, dans le Nord de la France, &agrave; partir d'une id&eacute;e qui a vu le jour en Autriche en 1949: offrir &agrave; des fr&egrave;res et sœurs orphelins un cadre de vie familial et l'assurance d'une relation affective et &eacute;ducative durable avec une m&egrave;re SOS, jusqu'&agrave; leur autonomie. Aujourd'hui et depuis pr&egrave;s de 60 ans, SOS Villages d’Enfants, reconnue d’utilit&eacute; publique, participe &agrave; la mission de protection de l’enfance en France et dans le monde. Elle accompagne des fr&egrave;res et sœurs dans la dur&eacute;e dont la situation familiale n&eacute;cessite le placement. Elle permet aux fratries de grandir ensemble, dans un cadre de vie de type familial, en s’appuyant sur une relation &eacute;ducative et affective durable nou&eacute;e par une m&egrave;re SOS. Dans le monde, la mission de SOS Villages d’Enfants s’est &eacute;largie autour de programmes pour favoriser l’acc&egrave;s &agrave; l’&eacute;ducation et &agrave; la sant&eacute;. Au total, l’association soutient plus de 35 000 enfants, jeunes et adultes dans le monde. Elle est membre de SOS Villages d’Enfants International, pr&eacute;sente dans 134 pays.

Nearly 200 employees serve more than 67,000 patients and thousands of community members every year.

      The Government agencies of Norway are state controlled organizations that act independently to carry out the policies of the Government of Norway. The Government Ministries are relatively small and merely policy-making organizations, allowed to control agencies by policy decisions but not by direct orders. A Minister is explicitly prohibited from interfering with the day-to-day operation in an agency or the outcome in individual cases. While no minister is allowed to give orders to agencies personally, they are subject to decisions made by the Government. Also, the Minister is normally the instance of appeals of agencies decisions.

      The Sudanese Red Crescent Society is the biggest and most decentralized and widespread humanitarian organization operating in Sudan. The society developed out of the Sudan branch of the British Red Cross Society and was established in 1956. Upon Sudan's independence in March1956 received official recognition as an independent National Society following the Sudanese Council of Ministers decree No. 869. The National Society covers nearly the entire country with 15 State branches and several sub-branches/units in the provinces/localities and administrative units, with a nationwide community-based network of 35,000 active volunteers and another 300,000 who can be deployed as need arises. It has well-established working relations with public authorities at federal, state and local levels, and good partnership and collaboration with Movement partners and UN specialized agencies and national and international NGOs working in Sudan.

       The Swiss Foundation for Mine Action is a Swiss non-governmental organisation involved in mine action. &quot;FSD&quot; stands for Fondation Suisse de D&eacute;minage, the French name of the organisation. FSD is politically, ideologically and religiously independent. FSD is based in Geneva and operates a logistical and administrative support office in Manila. From 2005 FSD was joined by its French partner FSD France, and from 2007 by CROSSTECH SA, a mine action company which is fully owned by the FSD.

It also monitors Israeli settlers, and aims to help the Arab Palestinians who currently live there. It is staffed by personnel from Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.

      Terre des hommes, also Terre des Hommes is an international charitable humanitarian federation which concentrates on children's rights, founded in 1960 by Edmond Kaiser in Lausanne, Switzerland. Terre des hommes campaigns for a more equitable relationship between the countries of the northern and southern hemispheres, without racial, religious, political, cultural or sex-based discrimination. The organization is named after Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's 1939 philosophical memoir &quot;Terre des hommes&quot;. Several independent organisations coexist under the name of Terre des hommes and work together under the aegis of the International Federation of Terre des hommes. The various national organisations of Terre des hommes met in 1966 to form the International Federation of Terre des hommes, headquartered in Geneva. Today, eleven organisations in Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain and Syria belong to the Federation. An important part of the IFTDH's work is as a consultant to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

Terre des hommes campaigns for a more equitable relationship between the countries of the northern and southern hemispheres, without racial, religious, political, cultural or sex-based discrimination. The organization is named after Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's 1939 philosophical memoir &quot;Terre des hommes&quot;. Several independent organisations coexist under the name of Terre des hommes and work together under the aegis of the International Federation of Terre des hommes. The various national organisations of Terre des hommes met in 1966 to form the International Federation of Terre des hommes, headquartered in Geneva.

      The Asia Foundation is a nonprofit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, our programs address critical issues affecting Asia in the 21st century—governance and law, economic development, women's empowerment, environment, and regional cooperation. In addition, our Books for Asia and professional exchange programs are among the ways we encourage Asia's continued development as a peaceful, just, and thriving region of the world. Headquartered in San Francisco, The Asia Foundation works through a network of offices in 18 Asian countries and in Washington, DC. Working with public and private partners, the Foundation receives funding from a diverse group of bilateral and multilateral development agencies, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In 2013, we provided nearly $114 million in direct program support and distributed textbooks and other educational materials valued at over $10 million.

       Turkish Red Crescent is the largest humanitarian organization in Turkey and is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The organization was founded under the Ottoman Empire on 11 June 1868 and was named &quot;Hil&acirc;l-i Ahmer Cemiyeti&quot;. It was renamed Kızılay by Mustafa Kemal Atat&uuml;rk in 1935, after the foundation of the Republic of Turkey. Like its counterparts in other countries, it is a non-governmental organization. All Red Cross and Red Crescent organisations within the former Ottoman territories are the successors of the Turkish Red Crescent.

      The United Nations Human Settlements Programme is the United Nations agency for human settlements and sustainable urban development. It was established in 1978 in Vancouver in Habitat I meeting and has its headquarters at the United Nations Office at Nairobi, Kenya. It is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all. It is a member of the United Nations Development Group. The mandate of UN-Habitat derives from the Habitat Agenda, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1996. The twin goals of the Habitat Agenda are adequate shelter for all and the development of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world.

       The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS, or UNAIDS, is the main advocate for accelerated, comprehensive and coordinated global action on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The mission of UNAIDS is to lead, strengthen and support an expanded response to HIV and AIDS that includes preventing transmission of HIV, providing care and support to those already living with the virus, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. UNAIDS seeks to prevent the HIV/AIDS epidemic from becoming a severe pandemic.

      Vredeseilanden is a Belgian independent and pluralistic non-governmental organization for development cooperation. Vredeseilanden wants to contribute to viable livelihoods of organized family farmers in South and North. We do so by contributing to the empowerment of farmers and their organizations to improve their position in the whole agricultural chain, from the field to the end consumer. By doing advocacy work and campaigning for better agricultural policies, and by encouraging consumers to choose for sustainable food. Through 7 regional Vredeseilanden Country Offices in Africa, Asia and Latin America, we co-operate closely with 142 organizations.

      When war sweeps through a child’s life, it can have devastating effects. As a result of armed conflict, children and young people often become anxious, depressed and withdrawn, or rebellious and aggressive. In order to overcome these effects of war, War Child Holland provides children and young people with psychosocial support, education and protection. We believe no child should be part of war. Ever. Children have the right to grow up in peace, free from fear and violence. To develop their full potential and become the person they want to be. Together we can change the future. War Child Holland is an independent and impartial, international nongovernmental organisation investing in a peaceful future for children and young people affected by armed conflict. We support children regardless of their religion, ethnicity, social background, or gender. Our work is based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. We implement programmes in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America, and Europe. Our head office is located in the Netherlands.

      World Neighbors is a non-profit international development organization that works with people who are struggling to survive in some of the poorest places in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Instead of providing short-term aid, World Neighbors creates permanent change by working alongside villagers, helping them to identify and solve their own problems, such as hunger, poverty, disease and other challenges that undermine their livelihoods. Currently, World Neighbors reaches more than half a million people in 13 countries. Since 1951, World Neighbors has helped 26 million people in 45 countries.

       World Vision Australia is an ecumenical Christian non-governmental organisation based in Melbourne, Australia. It is a part of the World Vision Partnership led by World Vision International. World Vision Australia was founded in 1966 after a proposal to start a new office in Australia by Bernard Barron, the head of World Vision Canada, and after startup funds were provided by the headquarters of World Vision in the United States. Greame Irvine, an evangelical Christian, was at the head of the Australian branch of World Vision. The first project of World Vision Australia was related to Vietnam.
