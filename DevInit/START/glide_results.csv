Three events of this same type were registered on the same day at 10:52, 13:38 and 14:50 local time, the latter being the most intense.

As a result of these eruptions and due to wind conditions prevailing in the Central Valley area, a dispersion cloud formed covering most of the northern Central Valley sector. The cloud caused the interruption of operations for over 24 hours at the Juan Santamara International Airport.  

This situation caused alarm among the population in the affected areas given that the Turrialba Volcano has been active since 2001 with increased activity since 2010.  This is the first time that ash has rained down with this intensity.

The National Risk Prevention and Emergency Care Commission (C.N.E. for its Spanish acronym) alerted the Technical Advisory Committee on Volcanology to conduct the relevant scientific studies around the situation so that first responder institutions and other government agencies could have the necessary data for appropriate decision-making.

The Cantons of Alvarado and Turrialba are currently under a Yellow Alert due to their proximity to the volcano.  The Costa Rican government is focusing work on four key actions:

The information is being collected by local authorities and assessment teams, so the numbers will continue to vary as the damage assessments are carried out and structural assessments of homes continue in various communities to determine the degree of affectation in the western departments. In the department of San Marcos, the Guatemalan Red Cross is conducting assessments that are more specific.

Given this situation, the government declared a state of public disaster for 30 days for the departments of San Marcos, Quetzaltenango, Totonicapn, Huehuetenango, Retalhuleu, Suchitepquez and Solol, due to damages caused by the earthquake. The purpose of declaring a state of public disaster is to restore infrastructure and essential services, and avoid greater consequences, as well as to allow taking any action necessary, wherever possible, to avoid or mitigate the negative effects and ensure the lives, integrity and safety of the affected population and safeguard their assets.",14.742,-92.409,,,,

Starting from 18 April the temperatures increased and caused the snow to melt rapidly in some lower areas. That had an impact on the river levels, with some smaller rivers and their creeks spilling over settlements  in places close to the river beds. The situation was the most critical in the municipality of Lu?ani and Kur?umlija. In Lu?ani, around 50 families were endangered by the increasing levels of river Bjelica, and one of the roads leading to Lu?ani was disconnected because of floods. On 19 April conditions got worse and an emergency situation has been declared in a few municipalities as the river levels grew above the normal defense levels. Presently, the most serious situation is in Prokuplje, Zaje?ar, ?itoradja, Kur?umlija and Doljevac municipalities where emergency evacuation took place in the lower parts where people were in danger. The situation remains critical as most of these municipalities are left without clean drinking water, since the water wells and the city water supply network are damaged.
So far, 11 municipalities have declared a state of emergency but more are in danger as the weather conditions in next couple of days will lead to fast snow melting and more rainfalls which will in return have an effect on the water levels on the rivers and on the people living in the nearby communities.

This is a 32% increase compared with the immediate previous year. A total of 319,244 metric tonnes will be required to cover the cereal deficit that the country is facing. 

The figures documented by the ZIMVAC assessment are primarily rural households and do not include the urban households. As has become a trend in food insecurity, the severely affected provinces in terms of percentage of food insecure population are; Matebeleland North (40%), Matebeleland South (32%), Masvingo (32%) and Midlands (30%). Post-harvest losses account to 20-30% of grain losses. Below is a table highlighting the most affected provinces and districts.

Late onset of rainfall, pro-longed dry spells and erratic rainfall coupled with limited access to inputs account for the poor performance of the 2012/13 agricultural season. The ZIMVAC report also notes that levels of child severe acute malnutrition exceed the globally accepted rates (4.7% compared to  the global rate of 2%).  Zimbabwe Red Cross has decided to target Gwanda district which has a population of 112,267.

The Maritime New Zealand estimates 350 tonnes of oil leaked from the Rena, and it is believed the ship had 1,900 tonnes of oil and diesel on-board. Despite an International salvage response to refloat the vessel the situation has worsened over the past few days due to the adverse weather conditions.

The Rena has suffered substantial structure failure, with cracks appearing in the hull. This has been caused by the movement of the vessel as the stern, which has remained afloat, shifting with the waves, while the front part of the ship remains stuck on the reef.

Urgent aerial surveillance is required. Current weather conditions are hampering such operations. Suitable EOS applications are now required to assist in the detection of pollution. The owners of the ship are making every effort to minimise any further damages to the environment.

Preliminary reports are that impact occurred on the Southern and Central Islands of Cat Island, Great Exuma, long Island, Crooked Island, and Eleuthera affecting up to 10,000 persons.

Most severe impact was caused by downed power lines to the electricity grid and an approximate 10,000 persons remain without power. Due to power outages, compounded impacts in food security and water systems which rely on consistent power are affected.
The disaster situation is expected to improve as power is restored gradually to the affected islands.

Since the two opposing candidates have taken oaths of office in different locations on 4 December 2010 and forming parallel governments in C?te d?Ivoire, there have been protests in the country even before and after the presidential election run-off. The situation has affected movement of people and goods within the country thereby leading to increase in cost of living as prices of food ingredients have soared. The fear of violence has also led to the movement of some people into neighbouring Liberia and Guinea Conakry. An estimated 4,000 people had entered Liberia with new arrivals reported in villages along the border at a rate now of around 150 people per day. Meanwhile in Guinea, the number of newly registered Ivorian refugees in the southeast of the country is stable at some 186 people.

A severe storm with a wind speed of 110 kmph accompanied by heavy rainfall preceded the cyclone ripping through the districts of Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hoogly. The coastal blocks like Sagar, Namkhana, Kakdwip and also Patharpraima, Canning, Basanti, Mathurapur and Kultali have all been severely affected and casualties have been reported. The West Bengal state?s Disaster Management Minister told BBC that 100,000 people had become homeless. The accompanying rains caused water-logging in large parts of the city, while power supply remained erratic and several flights were cancelled. Nearly four people were killed and 15 injured in Kolkata due to the storm that paralysed normal life. The usually bustling city streets were deserted since noon, as the authorities stopped tram services and asked people to stay indoors till evening.  

The city administration and police swung into action and virtual emergency was declared. Assistance of army has also been sought to help the civil administration in tackling the action.

Cyclonic storm AILA also paralysed life in several parts of Coastal Orissa triggering heavy rains and high velocity winds prompting government to gear up for relief work. No casualties have been reported so far.

According to the Regional Meteorological Centre Director, the cyclone now lying stationery 50 km west of Kolkata is moving in a northerly direction and will weaken gradually to a depression affecting the Northern and North Eastern states of India.",20.593684,78.96288,,,2009-05-26,2009-05-26

Acting on several alert messages from the affected areas, the Chadian government instructed urgent action from the National Committee of Flood Management (CONASI) to assess the extent of damage and subsequent needs of the effected population. The Committee members which include technical WatSan experts and senior officials from the Ministries of Interior and Territorial Administration; Social Affairs, Public Health, and other sensitive sectors with civil protection mandates, have been deployed to visit various scenes of the disaster in N?Djamena. Similar
instructions were given to the regional and local authorities to conduct rapid assessments upon which the
government and its partner humanitarian organisations could build plans to access the victims with adequate quality assistance.
Official statistics (as of 6 September) reflected the following:
? In B?bidja, 15 days of heavy rains with a recorded water level of 346 mm rendered 1,063 families homeless
(average size five persons) homeless. 1,706 houses; 217 sanitation facilities (bathrooms and toilets)
destroyed; 18 water wells; and 626 walls/and house fences were destroyed or collapsed.

This resulted in flooding rains from the lower Mississippi valley through the southeast and into the northeast, several tornadoes, and a severe ice storm in parts of the northeast/New England and into Canada.

Flood-related:
Tennessee--7
North Carolina--2
South Carolina--1
Kentucky--1
Alabama--1
Ice storm-related:
New York--9
Maine--5
New Hampshire--2

The heaviest rains and most severe flooding occurred in the mountains of North Carolina and northeast Tennessee, where up to 16 inches fell in a 2-day period. See below for some of the rainfall totals. Surveys indicate over 500 homes destroyed or with severe damage in North Carolina, and over 200 homes severely damaged or destroyed in Tennessee. Damages exceeded $15 million for western North Carolina and $20 million for eastern Tennessee. Tornado touchdowns produced some damage in Dublin, Georgia and Easley, South Carolina. Flooding also was a problem in parts of the lower Mississippi valley and upstate New York.

The severe ice storm mainly affected upstate New York, northern New Hampshire and Vermont, much of Maine, and southeast Canada. Some locations received over 3 inches of rain (as freezing rain), with radial ice thickness of one inch or more. Canada reported over 3 million utility customers without power immediately after the storm, while the northeast through New England reported over 500,000 customers without power. 80% of Maine's population lost electrical service.

Saint Helen?s, WA",,,USGS (http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/msh_may18_impact_aftermath.html),"The May 18, 1980, eruption was the most destructive in the history of the United States. Novarupta (Katmai) Volcano, Alaska, erupted considerably more material in 1912, but owing to the isolation and sparse population of the region affected, there were no human deaths and little property damage. In contrast, Mount St. Helens' eruption in a matter of hours caused loss of lives and widespread destruction of valuable property, primarily by the debris avalanche, the lateral blast, and the mudflows.

Landscape changes caused by the May 18 eruption were readily seen on high-altitude photographs. Such images, however, cannot reveal the impacts of the devastation on people and their works. The May 18 eruption resulted in scores of injuries and the loss of 57 lives. Within the United States before May 18, 1980, only two known casualties had been attributed to volcanic activity - a photographer was struck by falling rocks during the explosive eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, in 1924; and an Army sergeant who disappeared during the 1944 eruption of Cleveland Volcano, Chuginadak Island, Aleutians. Autopsies indicated that most of Mount St. Helens' victims died by asphyxiation from inhaling hot volcanic ash, and some by thermal and other injuries.  Accurate cost figures remain difficult to determine. Early estimates were too high and ranged from $2 to $3 billion, primarily reflecting the timber, civil works, and agricultural losses. A refined estimate of $1.1 billion was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of Congress. A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",45.9934438,-122.3795419,,,2007-08-02,2007-08-02

It rapidly intensified and by the time it reached western Cuba the next day it was a Category 3 hurricane. Camille tracked north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and became a Category 5 hurricane on August 16. The hurricane maintained this intensity until it made landfall along the Mississippi coast late on the 17th. Camille weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed Mississippi into western Tennessee and Kentucky, then it turned eastward across West Virginia and Virginia. The cyclone moved into the Atlantic on August 20 and regained tropical storm strength before becoming extratropical on the 22nd. A minimum pressure of 26.84 inches was reported in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, which makes Camille the second most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States. The actual maximum sustained winds will never be known, as the hurricane destroyed all the wind-recording instruments in the landfall area. The estimates at the coast are near 200 mph. Columbia, Mississippi, located 75 miles inland, reported 120 mph sustained winds. A storm tide of 24.6 ft occurred at Pass Christian, Mississippi. The heaviest rains along the Gulf Coast were about 10 inches. However, as Camille passed over the Virginias, it produced a burst of 12 to 20 inch rains with local totals of up to 31 inches. Most of this rain occurred in 3 to 5 hours and caused catastrophic flash flooding. The combination of winds, surges, and rainfalls caused 256 deaths (143 on the Gulf Coast and 113 in the Virginia floods) and $1.421 billion in damage.",37.09024,-95.712891,,,2007-08-02,2007-08-02
