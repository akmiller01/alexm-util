- ODA treemap for UK as a donor is much more red than overall, indicating the UK does a good job of targetting
their ODA to the poorest. That being said, there are still some small, crimson squares, indicating that they 
can do a better job, still.

-Global inflows 2013 treemap: Surprising the volume of long-term debt!

- DRM data is for 2011 from the OECD DAC CRS.

-The following are were the UK ranks in the global context for different sectors
For ODA in 2013:
*Education: 2nd place
*Environment: 2nd place
*Health: 3rd, with Global fund as 2nd and GAVI as 4th
*Humanitarian: 3rd place
*Other Social Services: 4th place
*Governance and Security: 5th place
*Banking and business: 5th place
*Other: 5th place
*Industry and trade: 6th place
*Agriculture and food security: 7th place

*Debt relief: 8th place
*WASH: 9th place
*Infrastructure: 10th place

-Interesting notes: The UK excels in many sectors, but doesn't lead the world in any particular sector,
but that's not necessarily a bad thing. More sectors mean more avenues to spread UK influence.

-The following are were the UK ranks in the global context for different aid types
For ODA in 2013:
*GPGs & NNGOs: 1st place
*Mixed project aid: 2nd place
*Cash Grant: 3rd place
*Commodities & Food: 5th place
*Technical cooperation: 5th place
*Cash (loan/equity): 13th place
*Non-transfer aid: 13th place

-Interesting notes: The UK does a great job of utilizing partner organizations like GPGs and NNGOs to
implement their ODA, and does better than many other large donors at avoiding non-transfer aid. (May not
be indicative of actual low-levels of non-transfer aid, it may just mean that the UK chooses not to report
it as ODA as often)

*Bangladesh: 4%
*Nigeria: 4%
*Afghanistan: 3%
*Middle east, regional: 3%

-Seems like pretty good dispersion across many recipients. Not too focused one one.
