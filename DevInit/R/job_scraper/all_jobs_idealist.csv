"Marie Stopes International - Senior Advisor, Partnerships and Resource Mobilisation",Marie Stopes International,NA,Londres,"About Us: Marie Stopes International (MSI) is a global organisation providing personalised contraception services to women and girls. Our local teams of professionals are passionate about the work they do in communities across 37 countries. The services we provide give a woman the power to choose when she has children so that she is free to pursue her plans and dreams for herself and her family. The primary responsibility of this role is to further MSI’s Goal: The Prevention of Unwanted Births and its mission of ensuring the individual’s right to : Children by Choice Not Chance. The Role: You’re going to play a vital role in in the future funding of Marie Stopes. In order to grow, we need to diversify our funding streams (with a commitment to double income from new and emerging donors in the next 24 months) and this is where you come in. We need someone who can look outside the traditional major donors of sexual and reproductive health (DFID, USAID, EU, Nordics, family foundations) to build relationships with emerging government donors who have perhaps not been a partner with MSI to date, for example in the Asia Pacific region (e.g. JICA) or new European donors (Belgium, France). You will help us understand how these governments might invest in Sexual and Reproductive Health and where we can partner with them. Not only will you need to look to new sources of revenue, but you’ll look to position MSI as a technical partner of choice. You’ll also be creative in your approach to building partnerships to deliver sexual and reproductive health services and rights. This might mean creating links with new sectors and how a focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights can support them in achieving their goals – and working with organisations we don’t yet know well. You’ll need to articulate and evidence arguments for investment from non-SRHR sectors - How does family planning support efforts to support girls’ education, for example? Essentially the world is your oyster – we need you to be innovative and you’ll be fully supported to ensure that fresh thinking can flourish. About you This isn’t your traditional Resourcing Mobilisation role – we’ll need you to be highly creative to create those new opportunities. You’ll need to have a new business mindset – not only the imagination to identify new sources of funding but the drive and ability to bring your vision to fruition. You’ll also need the experience, knowledge and gravitas to represent MSI to potential partners and donors with minimal supervision. Ideally, you’d have professional experience working with partners and donors outside of the Western context, but a clear track record of successful partnership building and resource mobilisation is most important. You will have successfully designed international fundraising and engagement workplans and demonstrated results within a clearly define timeframes, aligned with organisational strategy. You will have experience in market analysis and stakeholder mapping and will help us to move to a more comprehensive ‘client relationship management’ approach to our resource mobilisation efforts. You will have demonstrated your ability to track and convert political and cultural conversations into partnership opportunities and resource mobilisation efforts. Experience of working with advocacy colleagues to create proposals that address a wide range of elements in delivering development interventions is highly desirable. Your role will be to help us source funding for everything MSI does to deliver sexual and reproductive justice to all: service delivery, advocacy, metrics and evaluation and sector leadership. Development experience is essential although not necessarily in SHRH – while health related experience would be ideal, we would consider other backgrounds. In-country experience implementing service delivery contracts would be highly desirable. So if you think you’ve got what it takes to identify, grow and deliver new partnerships and new sources of funding, then this could be the role for you. What are you waiting for? In addition, you will be pro-choice on children by choice &amp; not chance Competencies: Collaborative: A confident communicator who is able to negotiate with diplomacy and build relationships at multiple levels. Strategic Vision : An analytical thinker who has the ability to see the bigger picture, identify opportunities and tailor strategic plans and adjust goals when circumstances change. Results Driven : A solution-focused individual who thinks ‘outside the box’ and can diplomatically challenge the status quo whilst maintaining harmony.

Experience and Skills Demonstrated record in engaging and influencing donors, senior policymakers, and civil society agencies to deliver strategic outcomes, partnerships, and funding.
